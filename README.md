# Windows-RAT
This repository will serve as an exploratory environment where I will rely primarily on C++ and Windows APIs to delve into the deeper aspects of Windows security management along with the varying components and architectures that come within the Windows environment.

## Repository Breakdown

### Pcaps
Packet captures between C2 and implant in a test environment for different commands. These help reinforce how interaction between our C2 and implant works for each command type. 

### RAT-DLL
All cpp *implant* side code that will, upon executing, open up a port on target and listen for commands sent by the user via Python CLI.

### RAT-Py
All py *client* side code that will, upon executing, open up a port on client and send commands to the implant via user input in the CLI.

### RAT-Exe
All cpp *implant* side code that will, upon executing, survey the target prior to loading our DLL that implements our functionality and opens communications back to client to accept commands.

## Assumptions
Current assumptions will include:
- The user has access to the target machine + network
- The user has the ability to or already has dropped .exe and .dll on target
- The user has remote shell/execution capabilities to launch payload on target
- Traditional antivirus programs have been disabled/mitigated

## Testing Environment
- Target machine is Window 10 Education version 10.0.19043 build 19043
- Python version for client is 3.7.16 (important for scapy use)

## Build Environment
- Visual Studio 2022 version 17.11.3

## Examples
### Startup
#### Required Args
- ip - IP address of target
- port - port number our implant is listening on

## TODO
### Exisiting Features: 
- Flesh out getfile functionality
  - Eventually add flags for offsets into file and chunksizes to send back to C2?
  - Should send back file size first then full size... currently only take 1024 bytes
- Flesh out putfile functionality
  - Implement C2 OK messages to ensure it has the param or resend if need be
- Flesh out dirlist functionality
  - Implement recursive dir lists + additional file info 
- Flesh out deletefile functionality 
  - Return number of bytes we successfully deleted?
- Flesh out screenshot functionality
  - Refactor; add output param for file buffer contents and send our data back in the caller not callee
- Flesh out registry functionality
  - Handle different reg data types
    - Should send back data type as separate return from implant and handle as needed in python scripting 
- Flesh out process list functionality
- Swap out success variable for ERROR_SUCCESS
  
### New Features:
- Implement registry key write add/delete
  - Add registry key value listing/add/delete
- Implement get system info 
- Implement password hash stealing via registry reads 
- Enable SYSTEM elevation
  - Have exe inject our dll into some other process's memory 
  - Or simply call system API with dll - rundll or something similar 
- Process query
  - Return specific info about a particular process
- Driver list
  - Return specific info about a particular driver
  - List all loaded drivers
- Start/stop processes?
  - Flags for permissions, process name etc.
- User list
  - Get logged on users, all users
  - Can do this via registry... or other way?
- Have exe perform survey, report results back to C2 and have C2 send DLL payload for loading 
  - Have exe survey running processes; inject DLL into target after running
    - Survey, report back to C2 those that we can inject, then get payload and start it; maybe self kill?
- Whoami-esq command
- Implement basic encryption? 
  - Give both implant and C2 same key or something for packet encryption
- Add specific error messages and translate function for easy debug messages
- Currently only support ASCII... could do unicode pretty easily?
- Persistence via registry or something?
- Add basic quit / cleanup      
  - Self cleanup off disk?
  
### Bugs
- Exe does not exit 'cleanly'
- Even if exe exits we do not alert our C2, so it still thinks its connected
- Put file
  - Large files may fail due to socket streams mixing comamnd values
