TODO:
===========
- Config file for target specifics (xml?)
- Add file size, file offset for get file 
- Basic put file functionality
- Process list functionality
- Dir list functionality 
- PSP survey for exe
- Break out functionality into separated DLLs - smaller footprint instead of loading it into one 
- Pass bytes to be loaded and executed? 
- Authentication options for remote execution?


BUG FIXES:
===========
- Main thread does not execute properly following a disconnect - something logic oriented here
